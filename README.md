## Capstone Project

Finish it up! You have until Wednesday, August 24th.

1. Fork the [Capstone Template](https://github.com/WizelineIntroToPythonML/capstone) into you GitHub Account.
2. Clone it into your computer.
3. Finish it up! It should be very similar to the work we did in the [Machine Learning Notebook](https://github.com/WizelineIntroToPythonML/11-machinelearning).
4. Push it back to the GitHub repository.

Remember, you can always ask for help in the `#playingwml-bootcamp` Slack channel.

## Thank you very much
